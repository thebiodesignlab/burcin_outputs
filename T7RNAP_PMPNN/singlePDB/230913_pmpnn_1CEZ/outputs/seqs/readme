These scripts are for calculation of pairwise sequence similarity
among PMPNN generated sequences.

1- Run format_allseq.sh to format the PMPNN sequences.
2- Run exec.sh that calls pairwise.sh
3- If there was a problem with any batch run, call compare4missing.sh to rerun the missing sequences.
4- Instead of exec.sh you can also call exec_reqjobs.sh which checks for failing jobs on the run and reinitiate it.
